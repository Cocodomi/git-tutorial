# Git Tutorial

Used git, but only a little?
Want to know more about collaborating with other people?
Check out our git tutorial!

This will be an intermediate level git tutorial.
It assumes you know how to do the basics, like create a repository, add and commit files, and what a branch might be useful for.
If you've used git for your own projects but haven't used it when collaborating with other people, this is for you!
If you're brand new to git, we'll be reviewing the basics at the beginning.
If you're a git expert, feel free to share you expertise!

Topics we're hoping to cover:

* Branches
* Merging & Rebasing (and why you might pick one over the other)
* Git visualizers
